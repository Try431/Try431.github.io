Today was probably one of the hardest days of the hike (not including when I felt like death for 2 days). It was cold and rainy, and there was a lot of steep elevation gain + loss today. I also was still pretty physically exhausted from being sick a few days prior. So while today's hike was beautiful, I definitely was not having a good time for most of it - but that's how it goes sometimes!
