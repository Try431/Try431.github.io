This maze of dirt roads was actually much harder to navigate than I anticipated - my maps were showing paths that were so impassable, they definitely hadn't been used in years, and so figuring out where I could actually go to avoid wasting time was a challenge. Signs like this were a welcome sight as I neared the end.
