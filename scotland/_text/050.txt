To add insult to injury, my phone decided to go into a boot loop that morning, so this is the last photo I have from today. This is a youth hostel that some other TGO hikers were staying in/around.

I spent the day running my phone's battery down as much as I could in the hopes that a full restart would be enough to fix it - thankfully I was right! Also, a great example of why having navigation redundancies is super important! I had my GPS I could rely on, as well as paper maps + compass.
