                                I'm a native-born Texan, raised on books, barbecue, and boiling-hot summers. I've always had a penchant for taking pictures of the things and people around me, as well as for talking way too much, and hopefully this website will serve as a (constructive?) blending of these two! 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                I hold a B.S. degree in Computer Science & Engineering from MIT, and am currently a Software Engineer at AT&T. When I'm not sitting behind a desk at a computer, I thoroughly enjoy most activities which take me outside, especially hiking. I'm also a Bass II in the <u><a href="https://angelcitychorale.org">Angel City Chorale</a></u>; a teacher for a local <u><a href="http://girlswhocode.com">Girls Who Code</a></u> club; a tutor/mentor for <u><a href="https://schoolonwheels.org">School On Wheels</a></u>; and I volunteer with <u><a href="http://habitatla.volunteerhub.com/">Habitat for Humanity LA</a></u> -- if you've ever considered volunteering, I highly recommend checking out at least one of these great organizations!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                If you'd like to take a look at some of my pictures, take a gander at my <u><a href="https://www.idgarza.com/iceland/"> photography galleries</a></u>*. Right now, I've got pictures from my trip through Iceland, my PCT/OCT hike, and a four-day trip through Inyo National Forest. I aim to get better over time, especially now that I have an actual camera...!<p/>
