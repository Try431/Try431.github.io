								<p>
                                I'm a native-born Texan, raised on books, barbecue, and boiling-hot summers. I've always had a penchant for taking pictures of the things and people around me, as well as for talking way too much, and hopefully this website will serve as a (constructive?) blending of these two! 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                I hold a B.S. degree in Computer Science & Engineering from MIT, and am currently a Software Engineer at KINETIC. When I'm not sitting behind a desk at a computer, I thoroughly enjoy most activities which take me outside, especially hiking.
                                Before COVID, I was a Bass II in the <i>Angel City Chorale</i>, and I volunteered with <i>Habitat for Humanity LA</i> and at the <i>Found Animals Adopt & Shop</i> animal shelter.
                                I recently moved back to Texas, and have recently joined up with <i>Chorus Austin</i>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                If you'd like to take a look at some of my pictures, take a gander at my <u><a href="https://www.idgarza.com/iceland/"> photography galleries</a></u>*. 
                                Right now, I've got pictures from building/sailing ice sailboats, my trip through Iceland, my PCT/OCT hike, a four-day trip through Inyo National Forest, a Bishop climbing trip, and a two-day trek through the John Muir Wilderness.
                                I aim to get better over time, especially now that I have an actual camera, but it's all in good fun!
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I <i>was</i> prepping for a ~3-4 month trip along the <i>Greater Patagonian Trail</i>, but COVID-19 has most definitely thrown a wrench in those plans. That trip is on the backburner for the time being, but I definitely want to explore more international long hikes in the coming years!
                                </p>
