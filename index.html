								<p>
                                I'm a native-born Texan, raised on books, barbecue, and boiling-hot summers. I've always had a penchant for taking pictures of the things and people around me, as well as for talking way too much, and hopefully this website will serve as a (constructive?) blending of these two! 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                I hold a B.S. degree in Computer Science & Engineering from MIT, and currently work as a Senior Software Engineer for <u><a href="https://binti.com/">Binti</a></u>! When I'm not sitting behind a desk at a computer, I thoroughly enjoy most activities which take me outside, especially hiking.
                                I moved to Seattle early 2024, and love being closer to the beautiful nature that's up in the PNW!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                If you'd like to take a look at some of my pictures, take a gander at my <u><a href="https://www.idgarza.com/iceboats/"> photography galleries</a></u>*. 
                                Right now, I've got pictures from building/sailing ice sailboats, my (first) trip through Iceland, my PCT/OCT hike, a four-day trip through Inyo National Forest, a Bishop climbing trip, and a two-day trek through the John Muir Wilderness. I also added a month-long trip in Portugal during January 2022, a multi-week hike across Scotland in May 2023, and recently a 5-day hike back in Iceland. I did a section of the Long Trail in 2024, but haven't gotten around to adding that yet.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                A goal of mine is to go on at least one long hike every year - while there are plenty of opportunities to hike in the U.S., I definitely want to keep exploring international long hikes in the coming years!
                                </p>
