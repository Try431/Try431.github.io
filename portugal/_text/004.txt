Aaaaand to top it all off, my bag (which contained everything I needed for a month) managed to not arrive in NYC with me. 

This was all the luggage that had somehow gotten separated from their owners and ended up at NYC. Don't ask me how that happens. Things were pretty crazy at the time (Omicron, winter storms, etc).
