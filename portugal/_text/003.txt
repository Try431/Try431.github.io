I actually ended up needing to fly back to the US (I chose NYC because of proximity) to get re-tested, but a series of (very much not) hilarious snafus resulted in me staying in that Toronto airport for a good 14 hours longer than I'd planned.

Lines like this were all over the airport, as flights were being canceled and delayed constantly.
