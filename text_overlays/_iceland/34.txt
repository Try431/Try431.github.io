On the beach of Djúpalónssandur, there are four lifting stones. Their names are Fullsterkur ("Full strength") weighing 154 kg, Hálfsterkur ("Half strength") at 100 kg, Hálfdrættingur ("Weakling") at 54 kg and Amlóði ("Useless") at a solid 23 kg. These Icelandic sure have a way with words, don't they?<br><br>

Traditionally, Icelandic men would have to lift Hálfdrættingur to their hips in order to qualify for working on a fishing boat. This friendly stranger surprised us all with how quickly he was able to lift the stone!
