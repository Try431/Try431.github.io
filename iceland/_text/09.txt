There's no HOA in Reykjav√≠k, so residents are allowed to paint their houses any color they like. As such, you'll find a myriad of colors all around the city! That's also why there is so much artwork everywhere. Unfortunately, my lack of a camera and any real photography skills yielded many photos, but very few decent ones.
